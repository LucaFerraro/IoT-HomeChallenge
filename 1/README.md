#Home Challenge 1 - Bernardo Camajori Tedeschini (10584438), Luca Ferraro (10748116), Fabio Losavio (10567493)

The aim of the project was to develop a TinyOS application implementing a simulated radio communication between 3 motes sending messages at different frequencies.
The messages are created using a data structure, specified in the Homechallenge1.h, containing 2 integers:
*SenderID: Id of the motes who sends the message.
*Counter: Integer value which counts the number of total sent messaages.
