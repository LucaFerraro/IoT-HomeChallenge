The aim of this project is designing and implementing a software prototype for a social distancing application.
To do this, we have used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TinyOS} for the development of the software that should run on the motes involved.
    \item \textbf{Node-Red} as IoT platform.
    \item \textbf{IFTTT} for providing a notification service to the users.
    \item \textbf{Cooja} for the simulation of our software. 
\end{itemize}

In the following sections, we'll describe first of all how to setup the environment for simulating and testing the software we
have developed. Then, we provide a brief description of our solution to the request of the project.\\ 
All the material we have used to develop our project along with all the home challenges we have done during the semester is
