The aim of this project is to design and implement a software prototype for a social distancing application.
To do this, we have used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TinyOS} for the development of the software that should run on the motes involved.
    \item \textbf{Node-Red} as IoT platform.
    \item \textbf{IFTTT} for providing a notification service to the users.
    \item \textbf{Cooja} for the simulation of our software. 
\end{itemize}

In the following sections, we will describe first of all how to setup the environment to simulate and test the developed software.
Then, we will provide a brief description of our solution and how we interpreted the request of the project.\\ 
All the material we have used to develop our project along with all the home challenges we have done during the semester are
