1) What’s the difference between the message with MID: 3978 and the one with MID: 22636?


- coap.mid == 3978
- coap.mid == 22636

Message with MID 3978: 
They are confirmable messages, since Type: Confirmable (0) and it is present an ACK 
message (packet number 6702)

Message with MID 22636: 
They are non confirmable messages, since Type: Non-Confirmable (1) and an ACK 
is not present.

Both use DELETE method as it can be seen in Code: DELETE (4)



2) Does the client receive the response of message No. 6949?


From the fields of COAP protocol we can see that it is a Confirmable message
and that it uses a GET method. To see if it has received the Response, we search
for the same Token = 6f:b6:3c:18

- coap.token == 6f:b6:3c:18

Message 6593 is the Response, it's an ACK message.



3) How many replies of type connectable and result code “Content” are received by the server “localhost”?


ip.addr == 127.0.0.1 && coap.type == 0


- ip.addr == 127.0.0.1  && coap.code == 69

"coap.code == 69" means "2.05 Content"

We can clearly see 8 packets with that features


4) How many messages with the topic “factory/department/+” are published by a client with user name: “jane”?

- mqtt.msgtype == 3 && mqtt.username == jane

We can see that the client jane has published 0 messages of any topic.

- mqtt.username == jane

We can see three CONNECT packet with protocol MQIsdp (the old name of MQTT), 
with Client ID:

0sMEkncjoYI47sofTNzUON

25cGIdhv5Oi9qC7l7Ykaju

5a9OJR9zWKLU8E8lqrAjvw

There is also a forthone that is a CONNECT message which contains also
a Last Will Message:

Will Topic: factory/department1/section3/hydraulic_valve
Will Message: error: cyisksbh

Searching for the three former Client ID, we can confirm that there are 
no published messages by client jane with topic “factory/department/+”.











5) How many clients connected to the broker “hivemq” have specified a will message?
  
  Questions
6) How many publishes with QoS 1 don’t receive the ACK?
7) How many last will messages with QoS set to 0 are
actually delivered?
8) Are all the messages with QoS > 0 published by the client “4m3DWYzWr40pce6OaBQAfk” correctly delivered to the subscribers?
9) What is the average message length of a connect msg using mqttv5 protocol? Why messages have different size?
10) Why there aren’t any REQ/RESP pings in the pcap?
